So now it's a wildfire you say. No problem our valet parking algorithm helped 
our fire-fighting learn how to plan out the most optimal path.

1. Run hybrid_a_star.py to see the plan planned using the combinatorial planner.
2. Run prm.py to see the plan planned using the sampling based planner.

Have a look at the videos we provide to see both the planners in action for 
120 secs and furthermore the combinatorial planner for a full 600 sec!!!!
